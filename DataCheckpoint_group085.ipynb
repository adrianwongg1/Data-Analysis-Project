    "The Super Bowl, an annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), is not only a significant sporting event but also a cultural phenomenon with a massive global audience. Alongside the game itself, the Super Bowl halftime show has emerged as a highly anticipated spectacle, featuring performances by some of the world's most renowned musical artists. With millions of viewers tuning in each year, the halftime show presents a unique opportunity for companies to showcase their brands through advertisements aired during the event.\n",
    "However, beyond the entertainment value and marketing, a question arises: what is the relationship between the popularity of halftime show performers and the sales impact on companies who advertise during the Super Bowl? \n",
    "\n",
    "Previous work has been doen on analyzing the influence of advertisements on sales without considering halftime show performer by highradius. They found that the effects of super bowl advertisements vary depending on the type of company and their relationship to others. An example of this is when two competing brands in the same industry air advertisements during the superbowl (Cola and Pepsi), they made no substantial gain on investments<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). In contrast media companies like Fox, saw a 10% increase on total revenue from the previous year <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). In addition, they found that companies have been hesitant to invest into a super bowl advertisement as the price tag is hefty. The variation in amount of revenue between the companies suggested that there is no clear answer to is the advertisement a worth investment for companies, but they can potentially generate lots of money. \n",
    "\n",
    "INFORMS' article expands on this potential to generate high volumes of money by pointing out that companies participating in Super Bowl adds not only see a sharp increase in revenue leading up to the event, but that these numbers tend persist into to the NCAA's \"March Madness,\" the NBA, and MLB games which all fall nicely into a timeline. This is particularly shown with Budweiser's ten-point increase in ratings around the Super Bowl, while a company like Coca-Cola whose ads are not associated with the event remain relatively stagnant <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). These findings reveal that it might also be important to anaylze data from the other fiscal quarters outside of the Super Bowl if we wish to find the a true relationship between Halftime Show popularity and said ads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EU Business School also reveals that halftime show popularity is heavily influenced by a celebrity's timeline in popculture, which is a factor the Superbowl must be able to leverage. Rihanna, specifically, generated more anticipation than usual performers due to her stance on police brutality and her absence in the years leading up to her appearance. Apple Music reaped thee benefits of her comeback with their decision to sponsor the show for the first time <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3), including her image and voice in their YouTube upload to maximize their exposure. With Superbowl viewership peaking during the Halftime Show, people are drawn in by the featured celebrity's relevance, in society and politics which provides a positive correlation for viewership of the entire event. Thus, it is clear the Halftime Show brings alluring opportunies for companies to increase their popularity, and the variance in popularity across different years affect which ads are promoted and the sales immediately following the performance.\n",

    "There are a few factors that we must consider with respect to dealing with ethics and privacy when trying to answer our proposed research question. For example, certain companies may release more data on their sales in comparison to other companies, leading to potential biases in the dataset. In addition to skewed data regarding sales data, we might also encounter challenges when analyzing an artists' popularity. There are many factors that can be taken into account for an artists' popularity including, but not limited to streaming numbers, Spotify charts, and various awards. Because we can only focus on a limited number of factors, it is possible that our results aren't fully representative of an artists' popularity. Additionally, we must ensure that we are abiding by the terms of the data we use in order to avoid privacy issues. \n",
    "Because missing information might cause our data to be skewed and is something we can’t necessarily fix, it is important to be aware of how these biases might affect our analysis and to ensure that we are being transparent throughout the entire analysis process. In our findings, we will make sure to acknowledge the effects that potential skewed data might have on our conclusion.\n"
